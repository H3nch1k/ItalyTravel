<h1 id="info_title">Which documents and certifivations are required for travelling to Italy ?</h1>

<p id="info_text">The documents required and the rules for entry into Italy vary depending on the traveller's country of origin. For citizens of the European Union or of countries that have joined the Schengen Treaty,
it is sufficient to show a valid identity card or passport. Those coming from non-EU countries must hold a passport that is valid for at least three months after the date of departure from the Schengen Area.
Additionally, depending on your nationality, you may need a visa for Italy, which must be requested from the Italian embassy or consulate in your country of origin. Pay careful attention to the timeframe: generally, the visa is issued approximately 90 days after the application. 
As regards anti-Covid regulations, as of 1 June 2022, it is no longer necessary to hold a Green Pass or other equivalent certification. There are no compulsory vaccinations for those entering the country. </p>

<h1 id="info_title">What is the time zone in Italy?</h1>

<p id="info_text">In Italy the CET (Central European Time) time zone applies, which corresponds to one hour ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (UTC+1) during the so-called solar time period, from the beginning of autumn to the end of winter. In spring and summer, on the other hand, daylight saving time is in force, which corresponds to UTC+2, i.e. two hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time. The dates for the changeover from solar time to daylight saving time vary from year to year. </p>

<h1 id="info_title">Which electronic payment networks are in operation in Italy?</h1>

<p id="info_text">In Italy, the currency used is the euro. Throughout the country, you can pay in cash or using your credit card, and in some cases also via a Smartphone. The main electronic payment networks in operation are Visa, MasterCard/Cirrus/Maestro, American Express, Bancomat, Postamat, and PagoBancomat. </p>

<h1 id="info_title">What should I do if I lose a document while travelling?</h1>

<p id="info_text">If a document is stolen or lost while travelling in Italy, you must immediately file a complaint with the Carabinieri or the State Police. At the consulate of your country of origin, you can be issued with the documents required to return home. To speed up the process, it is advisable to have a copy of the most important identity documents with you, just in case. For credit cards, debit cards, prepaid cards or similar, it is a good idea to immediately block any possible disbursement of money in order to avoid unpleasant surprises. </p>

<h1 id="info_title">Is data roaming available in Italy? Who can use it?</h1>

<p id="info_text">Data roaming is the service that allows travellers to use the mobile networks of other operators to access the Internet when they are outside their own country. When you leave your country's borders, you can enable roaming in the Settings of your Smartphone. Be careful, however, to check the available offers and tariffs beforehand to avoid running out of your remaining credit without realising it. If your tariff plan includes additional costs for roaming, it is advisable to connect to a Wi-Fi network. There are many free connections made available by commercial establishments and cultural venues. By downloading the WiFi Italia app, you can access all federated networks and hotspots provided by municipalities for free. If you plan to stay in Italy for a long time, it may be worth buying a SIM card from an Italian operator.</p>

<h1 id="info_title">What are the average temperatures in Italy in the various seasons?</h1>

<p id="info_text">The climate in Italy is generally mild but, at the same time, extremely variable depending on the location and time of year. It is wise to check the average temperatures in the area you are travelling, so that you can make the best choice of what to pack. In winter, average temperatures in the north of Italy range from a minimum of -2.7°C to a maximum of 9.9°C, while in the south they range from a minimum of 5.8°C to a maximum of 14.9°C. In summer, the minimum in the North is around 10.1°C and the maximum 24.4°C, compared to 17.2° and 29.6°C in the South.</p>

<h1 id="info_title">What are the power sockets in Italy?</h1>

<p id="info_text">In Italy, power sockets are regulated by Cei 23-50, all symmetrical and non-polarised, i.e. the plug can be inserted either way. You can find the C-type socket, with 2 or 3 symmetrical holes, or the L-type socket, with larger cables and prongs. The multistandard combines the two types and allows you to connect all types of Italian plugs and the German Shuko plug. If you need it, you can find adapters for different sockets in supermarkets, dedicated shops and most hotels. Electricity is distributed everywhere with alternating current, 220V and a frequency of 50 Hz. </p>
